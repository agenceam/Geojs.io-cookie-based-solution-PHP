# Geojs.io cookie based geo content

Hello, we have developed this little function to retrieve the country of an IP address in order to display specific content based on it. 

We use the geojs.io API which currently has no capping limit. We'veI opted for a cookie-based solution to limit the amount of calls made to their API.

## Features

- Country code injection in the "ctry" cookie
- If a cookie exist, no api call 
- Content conditionnement with JS
